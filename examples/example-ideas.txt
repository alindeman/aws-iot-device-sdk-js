			EXAMPLE CONCEPTS FOR NODE.JS SDK

Demonstrate a number of possible applications of Icebreaker:

1) Mobile App user monitors and controls Remote Device

2) Remote Device broadcasts data to multiple remote monitors

3) Thing Shadow stores desired state while Remote Device is offline; when 
   Remote Device comes back online, Mobile App notes that the desired state
   has been transferred to the Remote Device.

#1: Remote Device is a thermostat controlling a heating/cooling device in a
    building.  It reports the interior temperature, the current state of the
    device (e.g. heating/cooling/off), and it also has an on/off control.

    A simulation runs and transfers heat between the building and the outside
    world.  An insulation factor controls the rate at which heat moves between
    the two.  If the thermostat is turned off, the temperature in the room
    will move towards the outside temperature and will eventually reach it.

    Mobile App monitors and controls the thermostat.  The user can set the
    desired temperature and turn on/off the thermostat.  There is an indication
    whether or not the reported state matches the desired state (lets the
    mobile app user know that the Remote Device is still connected).

    The Remote Device side has controls for thermostat on/off and outside
    temperature.

    Ideally this simulation would be presented in two separate windows with
    some sort of graphical representation of what's happening.
